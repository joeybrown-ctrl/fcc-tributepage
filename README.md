## What's this?

Here is my version of FreeCodeCamp's first project for their Responsive Web Design module. 
[The user stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page) for this project indicate a general layout of the page, but the aesthetic was up to me. I wound up doing a tribute to my beloved cat, Tank, because why not? This was built using HTML5 and CSS, with a free google font. It was submitted via [Codepen](https://codepen.io/joeyBrown91/pen/MWvRajV) to FreeCodeCamp for approval.
