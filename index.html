                    - Life looks good for Tank. He has plans to move to The Land with Michael once the quonset hut is fully built and livable. He is particularly looking forward to meeting his future dog-sister, and growing old on a hassock in the Arizona room, watching the hummingbirds drink from the flowers in the shadow of A Mountain

            </ul>

                <p>
                    "Tank is a stinky, sweet, protective and incredibly loud creature. His early-morning operatic arias are the stuff of local legend."
